# Continuum_Random_Tree
This repository contains my B.S. thesis on Aldous' Continuum Random Tree.

Every content in this repository is written in italian.

Here you can find not only my thesis but also a brief abstract and some slides I set up to support the presentation of my work.

I also added LaTeX source codes but I firmly underscore that they are very messy.
